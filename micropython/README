# mp-sparkle

These files are used in Thonny to setup a Raspberry Pi Pico, or a Pimoroni Pico Lipo to have a sparkly light display.

As an additional feature on the Pico Lipo, pressing the 'boot' button while it is running will pause the sparkles and display the current battery percentage as green LEDs. These start at the base of the tree, and more green means a higher percentage!

# Pico Setup

For a standard Raspberry Pi Pico, set it up with Thonny, and install the latest MicroPython it offers. Copy `tree.py` and `randomsparkles.py` to the device and run `randomsparkles.py`.

If you want the tree to start on power up, rename `randomsparkles.py` to `main.py`.

# Pico Lipo Setup

For the Pimoroni Pico Lipo, set it up with Thonny, being sure to select the Pimoroni Pico Lipo variant of Micropython (latest version). Copy `tree.py`, `pimoroni_lipo.py` and `battery_sparkles.py` to the device, and run `battery_sparkles.py`.

Press 'boot' at any time while running to see the current battery percentage represented on the tree.

Rename `battery_sparkles.py` to `main.py` if you want the tree to run automatically on power up.
