# Raspberry Pi Pico SPI based driver for The Pi Hut 3D RGB Xmas Tree for Rasbperry Pi.
#
# The 3D RGB Xmas tree is documented in it's sample code, and is designed to be connected
# to a 40-pin Raspberry Pi HAT connector. It appears to require four connections
# - power, ground, clock and data. It seems likely the 25 LEDs are something similar to the
# Adafruit DotStar LEDs, and appear to be driven via a 2-wire SPI protocol.
# The LED's seem to be unfussy about power voltage (so 3.3v or 5v seems fine) and clock timing.
# The 40-pin connector has the clock wire on GPIO25 and the data wire on GPIO12
# (a nod to 12/25 as the date of christmas for the designer!)
#
# Mapping of SPI for the LED string. miso is unused, but must be supplied to SoftSPI.
# From initial experiments, 30K baudrate is just fast enough to make it appear
# all LEDs are updated simultaneously.
# Note that miso needs to be parked on an innocent (unconnected?) gpio. 16 seems fine.
# For the HardStuff Pico HAT adaptor, RP2040 GPIO 9 (exposed on Pico pin 12) maps to HAT GPIO 12,
# and Pico GPIO 28 maps to HAT GPIO 25
